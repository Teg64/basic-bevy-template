# Basic Bevy Template

This is a simple template repo for creating [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) projects in Rust. It contains only what I consider to be the absolute essentials for getting started.

## Features

- [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) and [bevy-inspector-egui](https://crates.io/crates/bevy-inspector-egui) pre-added to Cargo.toml
- Bevy's recommended [performance optimisations](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/#compile-with-performance-optimizations)
- A blank-slate game window, configured for 3D or 2D

## Requirements

Make sure you have [cargo-generate](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate) installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate
```

## Usage

To create a new project in a new directory, use:

```bash
cargo generate https://github.com/Teg64/Basic-Bevy-Template
```

Alternatively, to apply the template to an existing directory, use:

```bash
cargo generate --init https://github.com/Teg64/Basic-Bevy-Template
```

## Streamlining the process
If you use this template (or any others for that matter) frequently, you may want to add it to your favorites and default values.
